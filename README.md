# CS250_Sprint_Retrospective
1) How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   Interpreting user needs can be very simple if done well. User stories are created based on the needs or wants of the user.
   This helps when developing the program and making sure that the features the user want are included.

2) How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   Developing a program is a process. This process includes planning, backlog planning, and sprint. A sprint is where the work
   is completed. Sprints goals are assigned to the developers based on the product backlog. I hope to incorporate all of the 
   agile processes into my future development work. Agile is used in many companies and knowing the processes, such as the 
   importance of the product backlog, can only help in the transition to using these processes as a developer. 

3) What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   Being a good team member means helping other team members, making sure your sprint goals are completed, being supportive, learning
   from your mistakes, and making sure to be at the scrum meetings. There are many ways a software engineer can be a team player.
